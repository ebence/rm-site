About us:

Attila Juhász

I am a Rails developer, living and working in Budapest, Hungary. I love Rails, Github and Heroku.
I have been working on web related projects for nearly ten years. I was one of the first Hungarian who bought the famous Agile Web Development with Rails book back in 2006. Now, I have five years of experience working with Rails. I did frontend and backend works too. I love the full stack.
Another aspect is sharing. I teach beginner and intermediate classes of Rails at the Peter Pazmany University (at the Faculty of Information Technology part of course)
Skills

10 years web development and 5 years Ruby on Rails experience.
I’ve seen many setups, many apps and I solved countless bugs in big Rails apps.
I love the test driven and the behavior driven development and I know when to use them.

Bence Erdős

With software developer influence and engineering background I have had small development projects (from specification through development up to education) for 10+ years. I decided to learn Ruby in 2010, and I became a Ruby on Rails fan. I love how RoR and the surrounding ecosystem helps us, developers, to reach fast results with beautiful and clean codes.
I also like teaching. I was an instructor for software and DB technologies at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering of Budapest Polytechnic.
Understanding IT problems of business focused clients, finding the right solutions and helping them to use the software effectively are the most important things that motivate me.
Skills

10 years of software development experience
10 years of DB and SQL experience
2 years of Ruby on Rails experience
I solved several business problems with small applications that helped people to be more efficient.
